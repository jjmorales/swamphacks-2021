The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.\n\nSo here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...\n\n##🚀🚀Fidelity and Vanguard🚀🚀##\n\nYou want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.\n\nThis weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this. \n\n##SO MOVE THE FUCK AWAY FROM ROBINHOOD AND MAKE YOURSELF AN ACCOUNT AT EITHER OF THE TWO RELIABLE BROKERS. However do not transfer your portfolio as this can take weeks. Instead use RH to only sell once the squeeze is sqoze  @$4200.69 and beyond.##\n\nTLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading.

People who take personal-finance classes manage their money no better (and no worse) than the general population. When you apply this to teenagers, most of them will be even less likely to retain the information. Think about any ""life skills"" mandatory course that you\'ve ever had to take and how many students sacked off. I noticed in my high school that the same students who complained that school never taught them anything were never enrolled in any business courses, nor did they join FBLA. No, I did not go to a large school. My high school only had 1,500 students.\n\nIn my opinion, just establishing basic math skills and having children grow up around adults who make good financial choices that they can see with their own eyes in action are key. If a child develops the natural interest in economics, then good for them. They will choose to pursue these studies early. However, I think if you push, an average high schooler will not draw too much from it long term, or not as much as they could if they learned once they have actual practical scenarios they\'re in.\n\nAs for college, microeconomics is a fairly common elective that students take to fulfill a requirement. I started off in a university that was known for its pre-med program and med school acceptance rates and a popular elective for this random gen ed requirement was micro. I\'d say that all of my friends from this college took micro and they were all science/social science majors. I then transfered to a university more known for business and that part is self explanatory.', ""Well, I mean, if you don't major in economics or business you're not going to take economics courses besides any general education requirements. That's how college works.  \n\n\nAlso, economics and finance are two different but related disciplines."", ""Just because you didn't take those classes doesn't mean that they don't exist."", 'Best we got was a “hey look you guys should know about credit cards and minimum payments” 5 minute class time digression via my AP American History teacher in HS junior year.

[https://imgur.com/gallery/tnGKgEV](https://imgur.com/gallery/tnGKgEV).    I have set a sell strategy using my power of 2 theory from above. I    will sell four of my shares for $1024. Eight for $2048. Four for $8192.    Two for $16,384. Finally one for $32,768. I will under no  circumstance   EVER sell my initial 40 shares at $137.54💎🙌. I will  NEVER sell my ONE   THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR Nokia for  $4.84💎🙌. You can fucking   pry my 300 BlackBerry shares from my great  grand children\'s dead hands   on a planet orbiting Sirius A at  $18.85💎🙌.\n\nMy   galactic  empire🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 will be built on the back of these 3 companies. These    are TITANS😘🍪🥇 of Industry and I will be proud to stand on their  shoulders   and reach out to the stars🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. Or I will fail  trying🔥🤯. You have awoken a   monster you couldn\'t possibly have  imagined💩. The reason it\'s called ""The   AfterBurner"" is  thus🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. This is my low sell. This will only cost you   $155,552 a  small amount of rocket fuel. That\'s chump change for you   guys. I\'ll  go away or my rocket will explode🚀🔥. Though you\'ll hear from me    again soon. BUT for every TWO market days you keep shorting these    companies, and manipulate the markets the price goes up. I BUY MORE💎🙌.  I   will buy 300 of AMC💎🙌. Put some $$ in Silver💎🙌 and BUY GME💎🙌.  It\'s the oldest   market mechanic on the planet. Supply and Demand. I  have something you   need so bad it could liquidate the entire world  economy. Even worse for   you the vast majority I\'m never going to sell  to you purely because  they  are safely encased within my Diamond  hands💎🙌. I can\'t get them out  even  if I wanted to.🐒💎\n\nI  haven\'t   calculated the high yet. It\'s in the millions. Do you realize  what you   would do if you let it go that far. You would have turned me  into your   worst nightmare. Not only am I already a monster but you\'ve  given me   millions of gallons of rocket fuel🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. You don\'t  think for a second I\'ve   told everyone I know? You don\'t think that IF I  make MILLIONS OF DOLLARS   off of you that all those people aren\'t  going to give me their rocket   fuel🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 to put into our rocket🚀?

And  we\'ve only started. You can hide this now for $155,552 but you\'re    only delaying the inevitable. 10 years. I will learn EVERYTHING you   know  with the motivation you\'ve given me. I will TEACH everyone I know   how.  You are only delaying my empire. The people have spoken. They  want  out.

Next stop moon🚀', 'Love this so much', ' PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS  \n\n\nTo break this down for everyone who wants to know what to expect in the coming week:  \n\n\nAMC current status (30JAN2021) :  \nAMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)  \n\n\nNow what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.  \n\n\nToday’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)  \n\n\nSo Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.  \n\n\nBut this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.  \n\n\nOver the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.  \n\n\nShort squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.\xa0\xa0AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there’s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we’re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday  \n\n\nMy recommendation:  \n1. HOLD  \n2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it’s going to violently rise  \n3.

The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**\n\n \nShort Attack:\n\n1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They\'ve been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.\n\n\n2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.\n\n\n3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren\'t there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.\n\n\n4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they\'re artificially inflating the stock price. Haven\'t seen it yet, but they\'ve definitely threatened it.\n\n\n5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.\n\n\n6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.\n\n\n7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.\n\nBasically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.\n\nConfused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that /u/draemon_   provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:\n\n[What does counterfeit stock mean?](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html)\n\n**Need more proof?**\n\nJim Cramer himself, \n[""here\'s what short sellers do, it\'s illegal but when you have 6 days to get out and you\'re down you need to foment and wipe that guy out quickly"".](https://youtu.be/VMuEis3byY4)\n\n**This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube. (THANKS for this info, /u/blancochocolate)**\n\n* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:\n\nWhen (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new \'truth\' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it\'s a pretty good game.*\n\nInvestopedia [""Short and Distort"" - illegal short tactic ](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D)\n\n**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU, /u/catolicquotes**\n\n**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.\n\nSome of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer\'s retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor\'s position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.\n\n**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.\n\nThe compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.\n\nMost of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.\n\nsource: http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CS8PullingMargin.html\n\nStill TLDR: hedge funds lying in the media and selling fake stocks that don\'t exist to scare us.

Because every fundamental about GME sucks. The business model is prehistoric and there are few tangible assets.

Reddit a website or an online platform made up of many different groups, they cover a gamut of topics including Wall Street.\xa0 Those that use the site are called Redditors. The most popular group of late is “Wallstreetbets” which as of this posting has a membership of 6.9 million members.\n\nOne of the members and this is his online handle,”DeepFuckingValue” a 34-year-old named Keith Gill has turned the investment world upside down. Gill claims he has turned a $54,000 investment in Game Stop into 48 million dollars!\n\nWhile Gamestop has been the most popular stock in the news the Redditors have other stocks they like as well. The list of Redditor favored stocks include AMC, BlackBerry, Bed Bath and Beyond, Tootsie Roll, First Majestic Silver, and Nokia have all been written about on WallStreetbets.\n\nThe frenzy has targeted stocks that had big “shorts” or those who were betting the stock price would fall. Now there are many seasoned investors who are warning this is a bubble and in the end, the little guy who this Reddit forum is set up to help invest will pay the price. That said it is possible the experts are wrong and have underestimated the power and endurance of what is now a group seven million strong and growing on the internet. There were many who did not think a bookseller called Amazon whose market cap was always higher than its intrinsic value could become the third-largest company by revenue in the world. Still, the so-called experts are sending out the alarm that if not a bubble this is nothing more than an online Ponzi scheme using the stock market. Again the experts have been wrong in the past.\n\nThose who underestimate the power of a group like this on Reddit do so at their peril, this may be the new way of investing harnessing the power of the net.', 'STALYA RETARDS STRONK !!!', 'Ha!', ""what's next step?"", 'WHERE IS THE FUCKING WEEKEND THREAD', 'To all the hedge fund boys spying on us this is not a revolution like in history this the the 🦍 stepping up and telling you hands off GME to the 🌕 hell if I make enough I’ll buy a ticket to Mars when space x starts selling seats.', ""Question: how do you guys know that big hedges haven't bailed already?

Melvin and Citadel 🌈🐻 I will  tell  you I can be bought right now for the low price of $155,552. It\'s a   fucking steal! You\'d be an idiot to not take my deal.😅\n\nHere\'s my position. [https://imgur.com/gallery/tnGKgEV](https://imgur.com/gallery/tnGKgEV).   I have set a sell strategy using my power of 2 theory from above. I   will sell four of my shares for $1024. Eight for $2048. Four for $8192.   Two for $16,384. Finally one for $32,768. I will under no circumstance   EVER sell my initial 40 shares at $137.54💎🙌. I will NEVER sell my ONE   THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR Nokia for $4.84💎🙌. You can fucking   pry my 300 BlackBerry shares from my great grand children\'s dead hands   on a planet orbiting Sirius A at $18.85💎🙌.\n\nMy   galactic empire🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 will be built on the back of these 3 companies. These   are TITANS😘🍪🥇 of Industry and I will be proud to stand on their shoulders   and reach out to the stars🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. Or I will fail trying🔥🤯. You have awoken a   monster you couldn\'t possibly have imagined💩. The reason it\'s called ""The   AfterBurner"" is thus🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. This is my low sell. This will only cost you   $155,552 a small amount of rocket fuel. That\'s chump change for you   guys. I\'ll go away or my rocket will explode🚀🔥. Though you\'ll hear from me   again soon. BUT for every TWO market days you keep shorting these   companies, and manipulate the markets the price goes up. I BUY MORE💎🙌. I   will buy 300 of AMC💎🙌. Put some $$ in Silver💎🙌 and BUY GME💎🙌. It\'s the oldest   market mechanic on the planet. Supply and Demand. I have something you   need so bad it could liquidate the entire world economy. Even worse for   you the vast majority I\'m never going to sell to you purely because  they  are safely encased within my Diamond hands💎🙌. I can\'t get them out  even  if I wanted to.🐒💎\n\nI haven\'t   calculated the high yet. It\'s in the millions. Do you realize what you   would do if you let it go that far. You would have turned me into your   worst nightmare. Not only am I already a monster but you\'ve given me   millions of gallons of rocket fuel🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. You don\'t think for a second I\'ve   told everyone I know? You don\'t think that IF I make MILLIONS OF DOLLARS   off of you that all those people aren\'t going to give me their rocket   fuel🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 to put into our rocket🚀? They know that I know how to launch into   space🌕. I\'ve done it. I\'ve seen the light!\n\nEither   way you\'ve lost. The gods have been cut, bleed hard and suffered long.   And we\'ve only started. You can hide this now for $155,552 but you\'re   only delaying the inevitable. 10 years. I will learn EVERYTHING you  know  with the motivation you\'ve given me. I will TEACH everyone I know  how.  You are only delaying my empire. The people have spoken. They want  out. I  will fight for them to see the light.\n\nSee you Monday. 💎🙌 [https://imgur.com/gallery/1ivtIvl](https://imgur.com/gallery/1ivtIvl)', 'Actually Bilo is a mod here', 'Like I said, very funny retardation', 'It’s the law.', ""Starring JPow and /u/watchmaking's granny."", ""Wish I had the money for gold but the SQUEEZE HASN'T SQUOZE"", 'Nah bird cage where dfv dresses up but it’s a different plot. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115685/', 'She ain’t my grandma so it’s her problem now', 'Wouldn’t wanna catch the old age STD from gramma', 'Plus they’d be retarded', 'I put the lotion on the skin...', 'Puts on grandma and her lotion?', 'No kink shaming here', ""Hey great post!\n\nI am just finding hard to understand, if the stock goes to some insane amount like $10-30 K/share, how are those hedge funds going to buy back the stock ?\n\nIsn't that price going to make it so impossible to buyback (because the value is probably more than the assets those hedge funds have) that those hedge funds jusy find a way to 'bankrupt' or let go of their obligations.\n\nIsn't bankruptcy or even legal action going to be better than paying some impossible amount of money for those shares ?\n\nI was just trying to comprehend the situation and think what dirty trick those WallStreet leeches might pull."", 'I plan on buying 3 monday on Fid and monitoring the squeeze-squoze thing.

Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They\'ve been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.\n\n\n2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.\n\n\n3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren\'t there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.\n\n\n4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they\'re artificially inflating the stock price. Haven\'t seen it yet, but they\'ve definitely threatened it.\n\n\n5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.\n\n\n6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.\n\n\n7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.\n\nBasically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.\n\nConfused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that /u/draemon_   provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:\n\n[What does counterfeit stock mean?](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html)\n\n**Need more proof?**\n\nJim Cramer himself, \n[""here\'s what short sellers do, it\'s illegal but when you have 6 days to get out and you\'re down you need to foment and wipe that guy out quickly"".](https://youtu.be/VMuEis3byY4)\n\n**This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube. (THANKS for this info, /u/blancochocolate)**\n\n* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:\n\nWhen (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new \'truth\' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it\'s a pretty good game.*\n\nInvestopedia [""Short and Distort"" - illegal short tactic ](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D)\n\n**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU, /u/catolicquotes**\n\n**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.\n\nSome of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer\'s retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor\'s position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.\n\n**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.\n\nThe compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.\n\nMost of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.\n\nsource: http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CS8PullingMargin.html\n\nStill TLDR: hedge funds lying in the media and selling fake stocks that don\'t exist to scare us.

Net cash per share of KTG is now about 12.5sen with NTA/share of about 50sen/share. The cash injection is supposedly for funding of a recently announced glove venture (RM55m).\n\nThe major shareholder Greenfield Hills S/B (GHSB) sold its entire 59.65m shares in the open market at estimated price of around 30sen/sh shortly before the ICPS conversions. A few days later, GHSB announced that it has converted 29.629m of its 187.45m ICPS. The balanced 40m ICPS conversions should be from friendly parties (No substantial shareholdings were announced, so presumably they are strategically sized just below the 5%-threshold). Alas, they are no Santa bringing gifts post-X\'mas. Blood bath began soon after on heavy concerted dumping in the open market.\n\nOn 22 Feb, GHSB announced that it has sold 17m of its 29.629m freshly converted shares in the open market at an estimated price of around 27sen on 19 February. Would someone effectively acquires a share at 54sen, only to dump it at 27sen a few days later?\n\nThe motive was revealed on 29 February when KTG announced that it would seek a 20% private placement at an indicative price of 22sen/sh. Final placement price is to be fixed at no more than 10% discount to the 5-day VWAP at a ""convenient"" time. The placee are likely friendly parties of the major shareholders.\n\nYou would choke if you read what the funds are to be used for.

[https://imgur.com/gallery/tnGKgEV](https://imgur.com/gallery/tnGKgEV).   I have set a sell strategy using my power of 2 theory from above. I   will sell four of my shares for $1024. Eight for $2048. Four for $8192.   Two for $16,384. Finally one for $32,768. I will under no circumstance   EVER sell my initial 40 shares at $137.54. I will NEVER sell my ONE   THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR Nokia for $4.84. You can fucking   pry my 300 BlackBerry shares from my great grand children\'s dead hands   on a planet orbiting Sirius A at $18.85.\n\nMy   galactic empire will be built on the back of these 3 companies.

The reason it\'s called ""The   AfterBurner"" is thus. This is my low sell. This will only cost you   $155,552 a small amount of rocket fuel. That\'s chump change for you   guys. I\'ll go away or my rocket will explode. Though you\'ll hear from me   again soon. BUT for every TWO market days you keep shorting these   companies, and manipulate the markets the price goes up. I BUY MORE. I   will buy 300 of AMC. Put some $$ in Silver and BUY GME. It\'s the oldest   market mechanic on the planet. Supply and Demand. I have something you   need so bad it could liquidate the entire world economy. Even worse for   you the vast majority I\'m never going to sell to you purely because  they  are safely encased within my Diamond hands. I can\'t get them out  even  if I wanted to.\n\nI haven\'t   calculated the high yet. It\'s in the millions. Do you realize what you   would do if you let it go that far. You would have turned me into your   worst nightmare. Not only am I already a monster but you\'ve given me   millions of gallons of rocket fuel.

9,"Days ago, Robinhood had the potential to be a major brokerage and a top IPO. Now there's a significant chance they won't survive",12370,l93dum,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l93dum/days_ago_robinhood_had_the_potential_to_be_a/,"Bringing **millions** of new agents into the market, disrupting the whole industry with commission-free trading, an intuitive UI that any ape like us can use, becoming the #1 downloaded app across most app stores...

Without Robinhood, this whole thing probably wouldn't have happened and WSB would likely be stuck at 100k subscribers like it was 3-4 years ago. Because lets face it, a hugee percent of WSB use(d) Robintard because we're too low-functioning to use brokerages that use >4 syllable phrases like ""money market fund"" or ""moving average""

Something like this happening right before going public was **GOLDEN** for them. All they had to do was not be a corrupt sellout bitch, keep their huge influx of new users happy, and they would've been set to come out of this a more respectable, even larger brokerage, as well as a high-value public company.

Instead they decided to expose the raw underbelly of their shitty business model and go exactly against their entire mission statement. Even if capital/margin requirements was the reason for the restrictions (it was definitely a factor but protip: it wasn't the full story), it doesn't change anything about the end result. Who the fuck wants to use a BROKErage who can't guarantee functionality during historical black swan events that usually result in the largest transfer of money? And then, **even if** they can't maintain capital requirements to execute trades, they could have handled it better. Just fucking pull the money from somewhere. Take out a huge loan from somebody ASAP. You can always get instant money if you don't give a fuck about interest rates, which they shouldn't because it's short-term and like I said, it would've been **HUGE** for the future of the company. Another one, they could have restricted both buying &amp; selling of the trending tickers, or just go down altogether (RH users are very familiar with the app being down and losing full functionality, why is this time any different?). Yeah it would've sucked but at least it would've fucking stayed consistent with their mission statement of fair, democratic trading for all. I fuckin work at Wendy's and I can still imagine several better alternatives than the BS ""difficult solution"" they did.

And speaking of their mission statement, it's complete BS. It's just a sugarcoated way of saying ""lol we allow poor people to trade and have pretty colors"". They clearly don't give a shit about DeMoCrAtIzInG tRaDiNg FoR aLl. Because if they did, their business model wouldn't have been a Wall Street megacorp keeping the lights on by frontrunning user trade data.

And yeah another reason why ""volatiilty"" and ""trade volume"" excuses are BS is because they **increased** restrictions on Friday when both volume and negativity **decreased** lmfao. Screw this POS jokerage.

Edit: And the lawsuits up the ass. They just finished a $65m SEC settlement **LAST MONTH**, think their rainy day fund is big enough to handle something like this immediately after? Lmao gl


Edit: Tbh this fuckery was such a double win for Citadel because they get to force RH to manipulate the market while also signing their death note, which for Citadel means less retail investors....

It may take a minute to read, but to this poster and any one else if you are someone holding despite having made life changing money, then read this. This is for you. It is my thank you, from the bottom of my heart.\n\nWhen I was a kid, like around 8, my dad lost everything. This is me getting a bit personal but my dad worked his whole life to the bone as a painter. He invented the Pro Trim. The mini shielded paint roller. You seen it at wallmart right, things like Pro Edge for example? Cheap carbon knock offs that don't hold a candle to the real deal, which corporations make. Want to know why you haven't seen or heard of it?  You wanna know what the fucks in big business did to Pro Trim? They paid off my dads crooked lawyer and fucked him out of millions over a patent that is now in the lamb, and no one can touch because my dad was smart enough to run off with what legally made pro trim his. So now they cant use the same Pro Trim design, but the fucks have the shielded paintroller business down pat.  Then in the 2008 crash my mom and dad's bar and house were foreclosed and we lost everything but our mobile home used to get back to nebraska. (Note to this day my mom and dad believe it had to do with the corporation they worked with talking to the banks to deny us loans. Since illegibly by my parents they came around my parents bar, the Doghouse Saloon in edgewater florida, pretty much saying give us the rest of the patent or else.)\n\nMost of this is word of mouth from my dad. I have no proof, but I grew up on boiled blood against the wall street and big business goons. We actually have a home again these days. I still remember being homeless at 11,living out of a warehouse next to my uncles office using a literal bucket as my bathroom for like 3 years. (God the thought makes me want to cry, because it feels so good to have an actual bathroom again. Seriously, to any one who can not relate. It feels, so fucking awesome to own a bathroom. When you know what it is like NOT to have one.) . But despite our position being better now then it had ever been, we still are hard stuck. I am 25 taking care of my elderly parents, on little to no education and a lot of pride lol. Trust me, no one wants to get back at them more then I do, seeing you all do this is enough for me in the end, but I want to fight and hold to! Even if it means just my one measly share.

But if it means those cocksuckers feel even 1 ounce of what my family has been through. Then god fucking speed with this you guys on this! Seriously. God fucking speed to you all! It makes me so happy to see what has happened. This is historic! So i spent 300 I don't even really have to spend just to feel like I was a part of it.

Melvin and Citadel I will  tell  you I can be bought right now for the low price of $155,552. It\'s a   fucking steal! You\'d be an idiot to not take my deal.\n\nHere\'s my position. [https://imgur.com/gallery/tnGKgEV](https://imgur.com/gallery/tnGKgEV).   I have set a sell strategy using my power of 2 theory from above. I   will sell four of my shares for $1024. Eight for $2048. Four for $8192.   Two for $16,384. Finally one for $32,768. I will under no circumstance   EVER sell my initial 40 shares at $137.54. I will NEVER sell my ONE   THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR Nokia for $4.84. You can fucking   pry my 300 BlackBerry shares from my great grand children\'s dead hands   on a planet orbiting Sirius A at $18.85.\n\nMy   galactic empire will be built on the back of these 3 companies. These   are TITANS of Industry and I will be proud to stand on their shoulders   and reach out to the stars. Or I will fail trying. You have awoken a   monster you couldn\'t possibly have imagined. The reason it\'s called ""The   AfterBurner"" is thus. This is my low sell. This will only cost you   $155,552 a small amount of rocket fuel. That\'s chump change for you   guys. I\'ll go away or my rocket will explode. Though you\'ll hear from me   again soon. BUT for every TWO market days you keep shorting these   companies, and manipulate the markets the price goes up. I BUY MORE. I   will buy 300 of AMC. Put some $$ in Silver and BUY GME. It\'s the oldest   market mechanic on the planet. Supply and Demand. I have something you   need so bad it could liquidate the entire world economy. Even worse for   you the vast majority I\'m never going to sell to you purely because  they  are safely encased within my Diamond hands. I can\'t get them out  even  if I wanted to.\n\nI haven\'t   calculated the high yet. It\'s in the millions. Do you realize what you   would do if you let it go that far. You would have turned me into your   worst nightmare. Not only am I already a monster but you\'ve given me   millions of gallons of rocket fuel. You don\'t think for a second I\'ve   told everyone I know? You don\'t think that IF I make MILLIONS OF DOLLARS   off of you that all those people aren\'t going to give me their rocket   fuel to put into our rocket? They know that I know how to launch into   space. I\'ve done it. I\'ve seen the light!\n\nEither   way you\'ve lost. The gods have been cut, bleed hard and suffered long.   And we\'ve only started. You can hide this now for $155,552 but you\'re   only delaying the inevitable. 10 years. I will learn EVERYTHING you  know  with the motivation you\'ve given me. I will TEACH everyone I know  how.  You are only delaying my empire. The people have spoken. They want  out. I  will fight for them to see the light.\n\nSee you Monday.

The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**\n\n \nShort Attack:\n\n1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They\'ve been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.\n\n\n2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.\n\n\n3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren\'t there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.\n\n\n4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they\'re artificially inflating the stock price. Haven\'t seen it yet, but they\'ve definitely threatened it.\n\n\n5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.\n\n\n6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.\n\n\n7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.\n\nBasically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.\n\nConfused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that /u/draemon_   provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:\n\n[What does counterfeit stock mean?](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html)\n\n**Need more proof?**\n\nJim Cramer himself, \n[""here\'s what short sellers do, it\'s illegal but when you have 6 days to get out and you\'re down you need to foment and wipe that guy out quickly"".](https://youtu.be/VMuEis3byY4)\n\n**This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube. (THANKS for this info, /u/blancochocolate)**\n\n* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:\n\nWhen (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new \'truth\' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it\'s a pretty good game.*\n\nInvestopedia [""Short and Distort"" - illegal short tactic ](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D)\n\n**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU, /u/catolicquotes**\n\n**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.\n\nSome of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer\'s retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor\'s position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.\n\n**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.\n\nThe compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.\n\nMost of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.\n\nsource: http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CS8PullingMargin.html\n\nStill TLDR: hedge funds lying in the media and selling fake stocks that don\'t exist to scare us.
